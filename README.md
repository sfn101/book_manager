## What I Learned

This is my first time building a full-stack application using Python Flask and PostgreSQL, so I learned many new things, including:

- How to use the Flask framework
- How to use a PostgreSQL database
- How to use `psycopg2` to connect Python with PostgreSQL
- SQL queries and database design
- How to use the Jinja2 templating engine
- Using Blueprints in Flask
- How to retrieve data from APIs using `requests` (I used the Open Library API to get book data)
- Debugging and testing
- Using AI tools to help me code faster
- And much more...
